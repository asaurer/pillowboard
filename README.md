# dashboard

Tests: ![](https://circleci.com/gh/jerben/dashboard.svg?style=svg)

This is a **zero** configuration data-driven dashboard. Stop wasting your time setting up other dashboards, start throwing your data at this one!
The dashboard tries to make sense of your data and present it in a sensible way.

## Features

* real-time data
* event sourcing
* authenticated/authorized dashboard admin panel
* supports generic time series data
* supports two sub-types: ratio timeseries and absolute timeseries

## Roadmap

* more supported data types: gauge, n-tuples
* meta data support as configuration replacement

## Getting started

The fastest way to get started is by using `docker-compose`:

```
docker-compose up
```
Now open `http://localhost`, register, login, create your dashboard and start pushing data.
## Development

To run the backend with auto-reload enabled run:

	lein run

To auto run the tests run:

	lein test-refresh

To get an interactive development environment in the frontend run:

	lein figwheel

Alternatively you can use something like Cider for emacs:

	M-x cider-jack-in-clojurescript

and open your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

You should have two REPLs now, one for CLJS and one for CLJ.

To clean all compiled files:

	lein clean

To create a production build run:

	lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.

Get refactoring suggestions by using:

`lein kibit`

Run the bikeshed linter by using:

`lein bikeshed`

Run the eastwood linter by using:

`lein eastwood`

Run database migrations by using:

`lein migrate`
